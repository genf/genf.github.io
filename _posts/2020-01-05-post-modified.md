title: "New York City Testimony on Public Oversight Surveillance Technology Act"
---

On December 18th, I delivered testimony to the New York City Council on behalf of the AI Now Institute and urged the Council to pass the Public Oversight Surveillance Technology (POST) Act. 

The POST Act mandates a modest level of public disclosure around the use of surveillance technology by the New York Police Department (NYPD). The NYPD has long argued that the level of disclosure required by the POST Act would thwart NYPD's policing efforts by allowing surveillance systems to be "gamed" by adversaries, thereby posing a risk to public safety. Our testimony explains why this is not the case, and that failure to pass the POST Act presents a greater risk to public accountability and trust in the NYPD.
